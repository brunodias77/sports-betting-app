# EventList Store Integration

## Overview

Task 4.3 has been completed successfully. The EventList component has been integrated with the Zustand store and mock data, providing a complete solution for displaying sports events with real-time updates and proper error handling.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. useEvents Hook (`src/hooks/useEvents.ts`)

A custom hook that manages all event-related operations:

- **Automatic Loading**: Loads events from mock data on component mount
- **Store Integration**: Connects directly to the Zustand betting store
- **Error Handling**: Provides retry functionality and error state management
- **Real-time Updates**: Simulates real-time event status changes
- **Loading States**: Manages loading indicators during async operations

#### Key Features:
```typescript
const { 
  events,           // Current events from store
  loading,          // Loading state
  error,            // Error state
  retryLoadEvents,  // Retry function
  clearErrors,      // Error clearing function
  updateEventStatus // Real-time update function
} = useEvents();
```

### 2. Updated EventList Component (`src/components/features/EventList.tsx`)

The EventList component has been refactored to:

- **Remove Props Dependency**: No longer requires events, loading, or error as props
- **Store Integration**: Uses the useEvents hook internally
- **Simplified API**: Only requires `onBetClick` callback
- **Automatic Data Management**: Handles loading, errors, and retries internally

#### Before (Props-based):
```typescript
<EventList 
  events={events}
  loading={loading}
  error={error}
  onBetClick={handleBetClick}
  onRetry={handleRetry}
/>
```

#### After (Store-integrated):
```typescript
<EventList onBetClick={handleBetClick} />
```

### 3. Store Integration (`src/stores/bettingStore.ts`)

Enhanced the betting store's `loadEvents` method to:

- **Mock Data Integration**: Automatically loads from `generateAllMockEvents()`
- **Async Loading**: Simulates API calls with proper loading states
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

#### Integration Tests (`src/components/features/__tests__/EventList.integration.test.tsx`)
- Store connectivity verification
- Loading and error state handling
- Event status updates
- User interaction testing
- Performance and memory leak prevention

#### Hook Tests (`src/hooks/__tests__/useEvents.test.ts`)
- Initial loading behavior
- Error handling and recovery
- Real-time update simulation
- Store state synchronization

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Simplified Usage**
Components using EventList no longer need to manage event data, loading states, or errors manually.

### 2. **Automatic Data Loading**
Events are loaded automatically when the component mounts, with proper loading indicators.

### 3. **Real-time Updates**
The system simulates real-time event status changes (upcoming → live → finished).

### 4. **Robust Error Handling**
- Clear error messages
- Retry functionality
- Graceful fallbacks

### 5. **Performance Optimized**
- Efficient re-rendering
- Memory leak prevention
- Proper cleanup on unmount

## Usage Example

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import EventList from '../components/features/EventList';
import { SportEvent, BetPrediction } from '../types';

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const handleBetClick = (event: SportEvent, prediction: BetPrediction) => {
    // Handle bet placement
    console.log('Bet clicked:', event, prediction);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Sports Events</h1>
      {/* EventList handles everything internally */}
      <EventList onBetClick={handleBetClick} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Real-time Features

### Event Status Simulation
The system includes a simulation of real-time event status updates:

- **Upcoming Events**: Events scheduled for the future
- **Live Events**: Events currently happening (simulated transition)
- **Finished Events**: Completed events

### Update Mechanism
- Checks every minute for events that should transition to "live"
- Updates events that are within 30 minutes of their start time
- Provides visual indicators for different event statuses

## Error Handling Strategy

### 1. **Loading Errors**
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Provide retry functionality
- Maintain previous data when possible

### 2. **Network Simulation**
- Simulates API call delays (800ms)
- Handles timeout scenarios
- Provides fallback to cached data

### 3. **User Feedback**
- Clear loading indicators
- Informative error messages
- Easy retry mechanisms

## Testing Coverage

### Integration Tests (12 tests)
- ✅ Store connectivity
- ✅ Loading state handling
- ✅ Error state handling
- ✅ Empty state handling
- ✅ Event status updates
- ✅ Event grouping by status
- ✅ Retry functionality
- ✅ Error cleanup
- ✅ User interactions
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Memory management
- ✅ Performance with large datasets

### Hook Tests (11 tests)
- ✅ Initial loading behavior
- ✅ Store state synchronization
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Event status updates
- ✅ Cleanup on unmount

## Requirements Fulfilled

This implementation satisfies all requirements from task 4.3:

- ✅ **Connect EventList component to the existing Zustand store**
- ✅ **Load mock events data on component mount**
- ✅ **Handle event status updates and real-time changes**
- ✅ **Add proper error handling and user feedback**
- ✅ **Write integration tests for store connectivity**

## Next Steps

The EventList component is now fully integrated with the store and ready for use in the main application. The next tasks in the implementation plan can build upon this foundation to create the complete betting interface.
